## Data Structures

[Arrays](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/) are a series of elements(numbers, booleans, or strings) of the same type placed in phyiscal memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

 - [Vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) is a dynamic array, where the size can be increased when an element is inserted or deleted, with the storage being handled automatically by the container.

[Linked Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

 - [Singly Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/singly-linked-list/) is a type of linked data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence. It does not have any pointer that points to the previous node.
 
 - [Doubly-Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) is a type of linked data structure in which each node apart from storing its data has two links. A node consists of three parts: node data, a pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer), pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). 

[Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) is a nonlinear data structure unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or in other instances a tree's structure consists of one node called the root and 0 or 1 or more subtrees.

 - Basic Tree
 - Binary Tree
 - Binary Search Tree
 - AVL Tree
 - Red-Black Tree
 - N-ary Tree

[Hash Tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-hashtable?view=powershell-7.1)is a data structure, much like an array, except you store each value (object) using a key. It is a basic key/value store for mapping known as a hash function.

[Stacks](https://www.thedshandbook.com/stacks/) is a linear data structure that store data in an order known as the Last In First Out (LIFO) order. 

- LIFO (Last In First Out)  
- FILO (First In Last Out)

[Queues](https://www.thedshandbook.com/queues/) is a linear data structure that stores data in an order known as the First In First Out(FIFO) order.

[Heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property.

- Max Heap
- Min-Heap
- Binary Heap

[Graphs](https://www.thedshandbook.com/graphs/) is a data structure that represent relations between pairs of objects. It consists of nodes (known as vertices) that are connected through links (known as edges).
